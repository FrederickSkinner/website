        <p>great  review! i had a blast in the west side of the loop last week. i found a hidden gem in the old orchard field past the lazy s spur. if you keep going past the trail marker, you'll find a fantastic run through a dried up gulley-wash. just stay clear of it on rainy days.</p>

        <h3>ojai trial facts</h3>
        <p>ojai has over 200 miles of hiking trials, with over 80 miles dedicated solely to mountain biking! Most trials border working farms or ranches, so please take the time to learn your route before going, and pay careful attention to trail markers. ojai trails are mostly self maintained, so if you a problem, try  to fix it! if the problem is a large one, contact one of the local cycling clubs to let them know, each month they have a trail-repair day that is spent maintaining the trails you know and love!</p>
